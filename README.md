# VideoBackgroundSuppression
## This application will replace the background of the video with another image.
## For that, we will be using two libraries. First, is the media pipe library for segmenting the person from the background.
## Second, opencv for performing image processing techniques.

This application segments the prominent humans in the scene. It can run in real-time on both smartphones and laptops. The intended use cases include selfie effects and video conferencing, where the person is close (< 2m) to the camera.
